To import your file, simply drag the product file into Roblox Studio once your game is fully loaded. 
Alternatively, you can use the Explorer context menu by right-clicking and selecting **Insert > Import Roblox Model**.
===

=== 2. Placement & Positioning.
Move the entire `JSM | Scan & Shop` folder over to `JSM | SelfCheckout V3` **->** `Accessories`. If you put it anywhere else, **S&S will not work.**

You are free to move, rotate and scale your terminal model to your liking, although make sure they're all located within the `JSM | Scan & Shop` folder.

!!!info
Any misplaced terminals **will not** work, keeping them in their respective folders is required.
!!!

=== 3. Configure your S&S.
While the Scan & Shop is designed to work immediately, we recommend reviewing the SCO's configuration module found under `JSM | SelfCheckout V3` **->** `SystemConfig` to perfect your experience.

!!!info
For more information check out the [Configuration](/sco/configuration.md#scanshopsettings) page.
