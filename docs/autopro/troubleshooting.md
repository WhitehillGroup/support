# AutoPro Troubleshooting

![](/static/assets/banners/whg_aptroubleshoot.png)

Having issues with your AutoPro instance? You've come to the right place.

## Error Codes
Here are all the error codes in AutoPro.
### WHL-BDE has failed to connect to AutoPro (API failed)
This error code means that your AutoPro instance was unable to communicate with Axon. This is commonly caused by HTTP Requests not being enabled. 

### WHL-BDE has failed to connect to AutoPro. (Another controller found on network)
This is caused because your instance has more then 1 controller. This can be resolved by deleting all but one controller.

## Doors not opening but LED turning green
This is usually caused by a part blocking the door. Make sure there are no bumps near it or there are no invisible parts.
