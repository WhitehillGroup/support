=== 1. Insert your file.
To import your file, simply drag the product file into Roblox Studio once your game is fully loaded. 
Alternatively, you can use the Explorer context menu by right-clicking and selecting **Insert > Import Roblox Model**.
===

=== 2. Placement & Positioning.
You are free to move, rotate and scale the Doors & Controllers to your liking, although make sure they're all located within their original folders.

!!!info
Any misplaced models **will not** work, keeping them in their respective folders is required.
!!!

!!!warning
For each network, there can be only **one** controller. Pick the controller that best fits your needs, and delete any others to avoid potential errors.
!!!
===

=== 3. Configure your doors.
While AutoPro is designed to work immediately, we recommend reviewing the configuration module found under `AutoPro V2` **->** `Settings` to ensure they function as intended, and have the correct whitelist settings.

!!!info
For more information check out the [Configuration](/autopro/configuration.md) page.
